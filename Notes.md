# The Design
    The design of this site starts with two different interfaces. I want to create a site that uses a login Database based on two different
    permissions
    
    Site Manager: This permission will show a completely different interface;
    it will show things like contacts, Calendars, Bridge Templates, starting of a conference bridge and the ability to page teams out. 
    
    
    Site User: This interface will show a more end user friendly menu. Where they will be able to manage their own account, contact information
    contact order, etc. 
    
    
    Colors: Black, Blue, White, and Gray. 
    
    
    
    Javascript functions: 
    
    
   Definately will use a few things here; using React we could make a whole interface wrapper that will create a seamless experience for the use. 
   As well as AngularJS so that we can conserver server processing power.
