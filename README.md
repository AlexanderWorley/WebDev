# Meaning
This WebDev Respo is an idea that I have to create a functioning Conference bridging and paging site. The Notes.md will contain my 
thought process, progress, updates, and will act as a Journal regarding this project. 



# Base Idea
  In IT things break; and when they break they need urgent team intervention. Because of this sites like xMatters and Everbridge are making 
  millions of dollars off of what seems to be a easy to build site.( I say easy but the concept is easy, as is the front end. but the back end 
  may prove to be challenging as I barely know Back end developement)
  
  
# Skills I will use
      HTML
      JavaScript
      ReactJS
      (Maybe) Angular JS
      SQL for Databases 
      Tables for user information
      Tables for Conference bridge templates
         
         
         
# Skils I may need to learn
-Kubernetes for automation and deployment. 
      This will be extremely challenging and I look forward to researching this. Although the website front end will be finished way before
      I grasp this concept. It WILL take maybe 90 hours of research and testing to get everything set up to a basic level. 
     
 -Node.JS
  If I am to learn server side infrastructure then I will need to utilitze Node.JS. No doubts about it. 
  
  
  -APIs & Reverse APIs
      Although I have never quite understood back end Developement. I will definately try to build my own to gather the needed information. 
      I understand the actions of an API; however I do not know HOW they work. 
      
      
      What I know from APIs is that it is a layer of software that standardize the coding languages to another. An Example of an API is Microsoft's Direct X.
